Custom i3-wm and i3status Configs
These configuration files are specifically Customised for i3-wm and i3status on my setup.

Operating System: Puppy Linux Bookwormpup 64

Installation: USB drive

Currently, the configurations only cover i3-wm and i3status. If I experiment with i3blocks, polybar, or i3locks in the future, I will update this repository with new configs.
