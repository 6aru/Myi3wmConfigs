### ⚙️ What's Inside?

#### Terminal
My terminal of choice is Alacritty, customized with the Catppuccin color scheme. My shell is Zsh, powered by Oh My Zsh and the Powerlevel10k theme for a clean, fast, and feature-rich experience.

#### Editor
I use Neovim as my primary text editor. My configuration is lightweight, focusing on a minimal and efficient development environment with a few key plugins for auto-completion and syntax highlighting.
